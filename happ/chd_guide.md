### 1. What is Coronary Heart Disease?
Coronary Heart Disease (CHD), also known as Coronary Artery Disease (CAD), occurs when atherosclerotic plaque builds up in the coronary arteries. This narrows the vessels and reduces blood flow to the heart, causing chest pain, shortness of breath, or more severe outcomes like heart attacks or heart failure.

### 2. Pathophysiology of CHD
1. Endothelial injury triggers LDL accumulation.
2. Oxidized LDL leads to macrophage activity → foam cells → plaque.
3. Plaques may calcify and rupture, leading to clot formation.
4. Reduced oxygen delivery causes ischemia and myocardial infarction.

### 3. Common Symptoms
- Chest pressure or tightness (especially with exertion)
- Pain radiating to the arm, jaw, or back
- Shortness of breath (dyspnoea)
- Nausea, sweating, dizziness
- Fatigue, especially in women or elderly
- Silent ischaemia (no symptoms, only ECG findings)

### 4. Major Risk Factors

**Modifiable:**
- High LDL / low HDL cholesterol
- High blood pressure (≥130/80 mmHg)
- Type 2 diabetes or insulin resistance
- Smoking or second-hand smoke exposure
- Obesity (especially abdominal)
- Sedentary lifestyle
- Unhealthy diet (high in fat, salt, sugar)
- Excessive alcohol
- Stress, poor sleep, air pollution

**Non-modifiable:**
- Age > 45 (men), > 55 (women)
- Male sex
- Family history of early CHD
- Postmenopausal status
- Ethnic predisposition (e.g., South Asians)

### 5. Types of Angina
| Type                | Description                                |
|---------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| Stable              | Triggered by exertion; predictable pattern |
| Unstable            | New/worsening symptoms, may occur at rest  |
| Variant (Prinzmetal)| Spontaneous, often at rest or night        |
| Silent Ischaemia    | No chest pain; detected by ECG             |

### 6. Diagnosis Methods
- Blood tests: Lipids, HbA1c, hs-CRP
- Electrocardiogram (ECG)
- Exercise stress test
- Stress echocardiography
- CT coronary angiography
- Invasive coronary angiography with FFR
- Serial high-sensitivity troponins (for acute MI)

### 7. Disease Progression Stages
1. Asymptomatic atherosclerosis
2. Stable angina
3. Unstable angina
4. Acute myocardial infarction (STEMI/NSTEMI)
5. Chronic ischemic heart disease or heart failure

### 8. Major Complications
- Heart failure (due to reduced pumping)
- Life-threatening arrhythmias
- Sudden cardiac death
- Cardiogenic shock
- Stroke, peripheral artery disease

### 9. Prevention and Lifestyle Management
- Quit smoking completely
- Eat a Mediterranean or DASH-style diet
- Exercise: ≥150 minutes/week
- Maintain healthy BMI and waist size
- Control blood pressure and blood sugar
- Manage cholesterol levels
- Prioritize stress management and good sleep
- Limit alcohol intake

### 10. Medications for CHD
- **Aspirin or clopidogrel** (antiplatelets)
- **Statins** (lower LDL cholesterol)
- **Beta blockers** (reduce heart’s oxygen demand)
- **ACE inhibitors / ARBs** (protect heart function)
- **Calcium channel blockers** (relieve angina)
- **Nitrates** (quick symptom relief)
- **Ranolazine, Ivabradine** (second-line anti-anginal agents)

### 11. Revascularization Options
- **Percutaneous Coronary Intervention (PCI):** Balloon angioplasty + stent
- **Coronary Artery Bypass Graft (CABG):** Surgery for complex or multi-vessel disease
- **Emerging:** EECP, gene therapy, coronary sinus reducers (experimental)

### 12. Follow-up Monitoring Targets
| Metric             | Target                           |
|--------------------|----------------------------------|
| Blood Pressure      | <130/80 mmHg                     |
| LDL Cholesterol     | <70 mg/dL (high risk)            |
| HDL Cholesterol     | >40 mg/dL (men), >50 mg/dL (women)|
| Triglycerides       | <150 mg/dL                       |
| HbA1c (if diabetic) | <7%                              |
| BMI                 | 18.5–24.9 kg/m²                  |
| LVEF (Ejection Fraction)| >55%                        |

### 13. Sex and Age-Specific Differences
- **Women:** Often have fatigue, breathlessness, or jaw pain over classic chest pain. Risk increases post-menopause.
- **Men:** Present earlier and more typically.
- **Elderly:** Less likely to have chest pain; may show dyspnoea, confusion, or fainting.

### 14. Silent Ischaemia
CHD without chest pain. Common in people with diabetes, post-MI patients, or elderly individuals. Diagnosed using Holter monitoring or stress tests. Treated like stable angina.

### 15. Cardiac Rehabilitation and Post-Treatment Care
Cardiac rehabilitation is essential for patients recovering from heart attacks or major interventions. It includes supervised exercise, dietary counseling, stress management, and patient education. Regular monitoring of blood pressure, lipids, and glucose, along with medication adherence, is key to avoiding relapse. Mental health support should be included, especially for patients recovering from life-threatening CHD episodes.

### 16. CHD in Special Populations
Elderly individuals may present with atypical or silent symptoms (fatigue, confusion, breathlessness). In young women, spontaneous coronary artery dissection (SCAD) is a cause of heart attacks, often unrelated to traditional plaque buildup. MINOCA refers to heart attacks with no visible blockage, typically due to microvascular disease, vasospasm, or stress-induced cardiomyopathy.

### 17. Gender-Based Differences in Diagnosis and Treatment
Women are less likely to receive guideline-recommended drugs like statins, ACE inhibitors, or aspirin despite similar risks. This gap is narrowing, but clinicians must be vigilant. Side effects like ACE-induced cough are more common in women, influencing drug choices. Erectile dysfunction in men may signal vascular issues, aiding early CHD diagnosis.

### 18. Detection of Silent Ischaemia
Silent ischemia is often detected via Holter monitoring, stress ECG, or high Coronary Artery Calcium (CAC) scores on CT. Elevated troponins can indicate a silent myocardial infarction (MI). Blood biomarkers, echocardiography, and CT angiograms can reveal underlying disease in asymptomatic patients.

### 19. Advanced Pharmacological Strategies
In patients with diabetes and CHD, drugs like SGLT2 inhibitors (e.g., empagliflozin) or GLP-1 agonists reduce cardiac risk. PCSK9 inhibitors are used for those intolerant to statins or with very high LDL. Medication regimens may require simplification using combination pills due to polypharmacy concerns.
